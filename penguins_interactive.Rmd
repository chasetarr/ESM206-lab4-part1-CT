```{r setup, include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE) # applies to every code chunk
library(plotly) # install.packages("")
library(DT) # install.package("")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### Making an interactive plot 
- view(penguins) in console brings up the data

```{r}
penguins_graph <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) # stores this graph as penguins_graph
# color = species tells the graph to change the dot color based on penguin species

penguins_graph # now we have to call the graph to actually see it show up 
```

- using ggplotly to make interactive graph
```{r}
ggplotly(penguins_graph) 
```

### Making Interactive Tables 
- Comes from the DT package (data table)
```{r}
datatable(penguins)
```
